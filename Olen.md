# Olen Rebrand Brief

## Who Olen Was

**Olen of Lycia** - Ancient Greek poet-prophet, considered by Pausanias to be older than Orpheus. He was:
- The first prophet of Apollo at Delphi (according to tradition)
- Composer of the earliest sacred hymns sung at Delos
- Associated with prophecy, clarity, and giving structure to divine knowledge
- A Lycian stranger who brought Apollo's oracle tradition from Asia Minor to Greece

**Key difference from Morpheus**: Where Morpheus shapes dreams passively, Olen was the *speaker* - the one who declares what must be. Prophetic clarity vs. mystical dreams.

## How to Use Him in the Plugin

### Minimal Changes:

**Keep all existing lore**: Bosses, Tartarus, Eudaimonia Index, reward tiers, skill trees, boss battles, etc. - unchanged.

**Olen becomes the "voice"** - the oracle who speaks through the system:
- When the plugin suggests a priority → That's Olen speaking as oracle
- He's the ancient advisor, not the user's life coach
- Think: Delphic oracle energy - terse, authoritative, correct

### Name Changes Only:

- **Plugin name**: Morpheus → **Olen**
- **The Directive**: Optional rename to "**The Oracle**" (or keep "Directive")
- **Greeting**: Shift tone slightly from "mystical dream" to "prophetic guidance"
  - "Good evening, Valantis" stays fine
  - Or: "The oracle speaks, Valantis" if you want flavor

**Do NOT**:
- Add "verses" and "hymns" everywhere
- Change visual metaphors to temples/lyres
- Reframe activities as "sacred performances"
- Over-explain Olen to the user

### Visual/Aesthetic:

**Keep**: Elysian Dark palette, frosted glass, warm gold, all current design language

**Optional subtle addition**: Olen could have a small sigil/icon - something Apollonian (laurel wreath, simple lyre, or sun disk) that appears when the oracle speaks

## User-Facing Positioning

The app is still a **mythological life-operating system**. Olen is just the name - the ancient oracle advising you. Users don't need to know who Olen was historically. 

If they ask: *"Olen was the first prophet of Apollo - the original oracle. He speaks through the system to guide your priorities."*

That's it. The depth is there if they want to research, but it's not shoved in their face.

## Tone Shift

**From**: Nocturnal mysticism, dream revelation  
**To**: Oracular clarity, prophetic precision

The system still feels ancient and mythological, but less "you're entering a dream" and more "the oracle has spoken." Same elegance, slightly sharper edge.

## Implementation

For Claude Code: This is a **name + subtle tone rebrand**, not a complete overhaul. The mechanics, visual design, and user experience remain the same. Olen is the mythological figure behind the voice that gives directives - ancient, authoritative, prophetic. That's the entire shift.
